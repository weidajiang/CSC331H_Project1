###Design and implement a class representing a circular doubly linked list. The class must have the following requirements:

###1.	The linked list and the nodes must be implemented as  C++ templates
###2.	It must include a constructor, a destructor, a copy constructor and an operator=
###3.	It must include functions to delete a given item, search for a given item, empty the list, check if the list is empty, ###return the length of the list 
###4.	It must include functions to insert at the front and at the back of the list
###5.	It must provide an iterator to access items from front to back
###6.	It must provide an iterator to access items from back to front


###Write a menu-driven program to test all the functions in your class. To test your iterators, include in your menu options ###to print the list front to back and back to front.
